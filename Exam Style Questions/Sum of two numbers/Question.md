# Question

Write a program which works out the sum of two numbers. Program should:
- contain necessary variables with hard coded values
- outputs to terminal with sum of thwes two numbers

## Logic

The question does not specify the need of any user input therefore: 

We state two const variables with values x and y. A printf statement is then used to print the sum with 2 decimal places, hence a float is needed.
