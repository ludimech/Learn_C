# Question

Write a program which works out the difference of two numbers. The program should:
- contain necessary variables with hard coded values 
- outputs to terminal the difference of the two numbers
- outputs with 2.d.p

## Logic

No user input needed, hence declare two constant variables that hold the two numbers. Another variable represents the difference. Use printf statement to print to console.
